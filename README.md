# software-research-repo

Welcome to my Research Repo!
---------------------------
This Repo has been created to showcase my Github skills and will act as a research repo for code that I find useful as well as code that I have created myself.

---------------------------
The first folder in my Repo is ticketingSystem, which contain my code that is written in Python for an IT ticktingSysetm. A Readme file has been to that folder to further explain the aim of the code. 

---------------------------
The second folder is "usefulCode", which contains the code for a todo list written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I found it useful as I am planning to learn those languages next.

Thank you!
